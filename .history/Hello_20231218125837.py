        ### Deployment flow
        When making changes in the code, save the script and click 'i' on top right to refresh. After this, each saving script could lead to a page refresh.

        ### Data flow (this might be drawback)
        Streamlit reruns your entire Python script from top to bottom. This can happen in two situations:
        - Whenever you modify your app's source code.
        - Whenever a user interacts with widgets in the app. For example, when dragging a slider, entering text in an input box, or clicking a button.
